# 🚀 START HERE - Quick Setup Guide

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

## Step 2: Make Sure MongoDB is Running

### Check if MongoDB is installed:

```bash
net start MongoDB
```

```

This will create 4 demo users:
- **Admin**: admin@hrms.com / admin123
- **HR**: hr@hrms.com / hr123
- **Manager**: manager@hrms.com / manager123
- **Employee**: employee@hrms.com / employee123

## Step 4: Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
✓ Ready in 2.5s
○ Local:   http://localhost:3000
```

2. Go to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You'll be redirected to the login page

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
**Solution:** Make sure MongoDB is running
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
mongosh

# If not running, start it
net start MongoDB  # Windows
```

### Problem: "Port 3000 already in use"
**Solution:** Kill the process or use different port
```bash
# Use different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Problem: "Module not found"
**Solution:** Reinstall dependencies
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Problem: "User already exists"
**Solution:** The database already has users. Just login with existing credentials.
