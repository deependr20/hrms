## Step 1: Install Dependencies

Wait for all packages to install (this may take 2-3 minutes).

## Step 2: Make Sure MongoDB is Running

### Check if MongoDB is installed:
```bash
mongosh --version
```

If not installed, download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

### Start MongoDB:

**Windows:**
```bash
net start MongoDB
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew services start mongodb-community
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

## Step 3: Create Admin User (Seed Database)

Run this command to create default users:

```bash
npm run seed
```

This will create 4 demo users:
- **Admin**: admin@hrms.com / admin123
- **HR**: hr@hrms.com / hr123
- **Manager**: manager@hrms.com / manager123
- **Employee**: employee@hrms.com / employee123

## Step 4: Start the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
âœ“ Ready in 2.5s
â—‹ Local:   http://localhost:3000
```

## Step 5: Login

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **http://localhost:3000**
3. You'll be redirected to the login page
4. Use these credentials:

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"
**Solution:** Make sure MongoDB is running
```bash
# Check MongoDB status
mongosh

# If not running, start it
net start MongoDB  # Windows
```

### Problem: "Port 3000 already in use"
**Solution:** Kill the process or use different port
```bash
# Use different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Problem: "Module not found"
**Solution:** Reinstall dependencies
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Problem: "User already exists"
**Solution:** The database already has users. Just login with existing credentials.
