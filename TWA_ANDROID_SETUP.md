## üîß Configuration Details

### **Package Information**
```json
{
  "package_name": "sbs.zenova.twa",
  "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
    "D7:6D:0B:B9:9B:B9:6A:8C:15:F0:EE:9A:E3:F8:21:65:20:4C:CB:91:F3:80:E4:0D:C4:FC:6C:BF:24:32:3D:E1"
  ]
}
```

### **Digital Asset Links**
The `assetlinks.json` file establishes trust between:
- **Your Website:** `https://yourdomain.com`
- **Your Android App:** `sbs.zenova.twa`

This allows the Android app to open your website in a TWA without showing the browser UI.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Issue 1: Digital Asset Links Not Verified**

**Symptoms:**
- App opens in browser instead of TWA
- Address bar visible

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `assetlinks.json` is accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
2. Check SHA-256 fingerprint matches your app's signing certificate
3. Wait 24-48 hours for Google to verify (can take time)
4. Clear app data and reinstall

**Force verification:**
```bash
adb shell pm verify-app-links --re-verify sbs.zenova.twa
```

---

### **Issue 2: App Not Opening URLs**

**Symptoms:**
- Deep links don't work
- External links open in browser

**Solutions:**
1. Add intent filters in AndroidManifest.xml (PWABuilder does this automatically)

3. Check `start_url` in manifest.json

---

### **Issue 3: Splash Screen Not Showing**

**Symptoms:**
- White screen on app launch
- No splash screen

**Solutions:**
